# Evan's leetcode Project

I got tired of waiting for re-runs for simple things like debugging so I built a project to be able to do leetcode problems in a quicker fashion.

Plus, this way I can own the source and build a project around it!

# README...README?

This readme is automatically generated from the problems directory. The runtime & memory usage is assigned onto the function exported in the index.js, and is used to produce the problem name & runtime/memory values you see in the readme. This markdown? Joined via the produceReadme.js file. READMEception.
